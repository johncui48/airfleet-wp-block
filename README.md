# Airfleet Block

Created a new child theme from [Twenty Twenty-One](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwentyone/) and added a Airfleet custom block using [ACF Pro](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/pro/).

## Block Detail
The main goal is to create a Gutenberg block that supports two different views according to the design. Check Figma design [here](https://www.figma.com/file/xI9JqY0mp2xBMj6W5jzI0L/ACF_Gutenberg-Block).

And it should be pixel perfect and responsive for multiple screens and enable users to edit contents and values on the editor.
